Add the Filter list to any ABPlus Filter compatable browser addon using the button below.

[![Install ABP](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install-For%20ABP%20Filter-red?style=for-the-badge)](abp:subscribe?location=https//pwnulatr.github.io/blocklist/ABP-Filter&title=Pwnulatr%27s%20Misinformation%20and%20Propaganda%20Blocklist)
## Option 2
Append the hosts file to your own hosts file on your operating system, or, add it as another source in [Steven Black's Hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts).
## Option 3
If you use a [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), you can add the [domains file](domains) to your blocklist. This will also work when added to uBlock Origin or other compatible browser-based blockers.
## Option 4
Use [BlockTube](https://github.com/amitbl/blocktube) to also block YouTube channels from appearing that also spread misinformation. Just import the `blocktube_backup.json` from [here](blocktube_backup.json).
